# Cat Oddessy 

A Python based adventure text game

A serial catnapper has been terrorising London
You, a Persian cat, have been stolen from your beloved family in West London and find yourself in a dingy townnhouse at a secret address in Spitalfields, 8 miles across town.
While Scotland Yard sleuths attempt to track him down, you must escape and navigate Londonâ€™s streets to your home, before he catches you again. 

A game built for fun mostly, created mainly to develop my Python skils.
built around if/else statments as the user progresses to the next level.

 Launches in terminal from main.py

 enjoy playing :)
